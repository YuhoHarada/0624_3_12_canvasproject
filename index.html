        <h2>Great ideas happen when we come together</h2>
        <p>
            We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas that happen when we build something together. We’re calling it The Canvas Project.
        </p>
        <p>
            And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to set the backdrop for your next get-together over <span>Hangouts Meet</span>.

        <h2>Meet the artists</h2>
        <p>
            Influenced by the power of collaboration and connection these artists created both photographic and illustrative wallpapers for the Meet experience.
